## Abstract
This project implements the retro **Snake Game** on an FPGA board using Verilog HDL. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the capabilities of FPGA platforms in creating real-time, interactive digital environments. The project showcases digital design, FPGA programming, and hardware-software integration, serving as a hands-on experience in these areas.

## Introduction
The project leverages the versatility of **FPGAs** (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) to implement the classic Snake Game. Players control a snake to consume randomly appearing apples while avoiding collisions with walls or itself. The simplicity of the game combined with its real-time nature makes it an ideal demonstration of FPGA capabilities.

This implementation explores core aspects of digital design, including:
- Combinational and sequential logic
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- Peripheral interfacing

## Objectives
- Develop Verilog modules to control snake movement, generate random apples, and detect collisions.
- Use **Xilinx Vivado** for RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and implementation.
- Program the FPGA (preferably Altera Cyclone IV) with the designed modules and test it on hardware.
- Interface the FPGA with a **VGA display** to project the game onto a monitor.
- Design a user interface using buttons, switches, or external controllers.
- Provide real-time player feedback, including score display and game-over notifications.
- Extend the game with features like bonus apples, speed boosts, and obstacles.

## Substitutes
- If the **Altera DE2-115** board is unavailable, we can use the **Nexys 4 Artix 7** board.
- In case of VGA controller issues, an **LED matrix** can be used to demonstrate the game.
- If the FPGA buttons are unresponsive, we can use a **PS2 keyboard** as input.

## Learning Outcomes
- Design and implement combinational and sequential logic circuits, including FSMs.
- Implement pseudo-random number generators and real-time collision detection algorithms in hardware.
- Gain proficiency in **Verilog** and **RTL** code.
- Understand how to generate **VGA signals** for monitor display and how to interface with input devices.
- Learn debugging techniques for FPGA hardware.
